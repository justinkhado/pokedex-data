The result is looked up in the following table.\n\nValue | Type\n----: | --------\n    0 | fighting\n    1 | flying\n    2 | poison\n    3 | ground\n    4 | rock\n    5 | bug\n    6 | ghost\n    7 | steel\n    8 | fire\n    9 | water\n   10 | grass\n   11 | electric\n   12 | psychic\n   13 | ice\n   14 | dragon\n   15 | dark\n\nThis move thus cannot be normal.  Most other types have an equal 1/16 chance to be selected, given random IVs.  However, due to the flooring used here, bug, fighting, and grass appear 5/64 of the time, and dark only 1/64 of the time.",

If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked.\n\nlife orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.\n\nThe user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes.\n\nThe doll is passed on by baton pass.
