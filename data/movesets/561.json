Power and type are determined by the user's IVs.\n\nPower is given by `x * 40 / 63 + 30`.  `x` is obtained by arranging bit 1 from the IV for each of Special Defense, Special Attack, Speed, Defense, Attack, and HP in that order.  (Bit 1 is 1 if the IV is of the form `4n + 2` or `4n + 3`.  `x` is then 64 * Special Defense IV bit 1, plus 32 * Special Attack IV bit 1, etc.)\n\nPower is always between 30 and 70, inclusive.  Average power is 49.5.\n\nType is given by `y * 15 / 63`, where `y` is similar to `x` above, except constructed from bit 0.  (Bit 0 is 1 if the IV is odd.)  The result is looked up in the following table.\n\nValue | Type\n----: | --------\n    0 | fighting\n    1 | flying\n    2 | poison\n    3 | ground\n    4 | rock\n    5 | bug\n    6 | ghost\n    7 | steel\n    8 | fire\n    9 | water\n   10 | grass\n   11 | electric\n   12 | psychic\n   13 | ice\n   14 | dragon\n   15 | dark\n\nThis move thus cannot be normal.
