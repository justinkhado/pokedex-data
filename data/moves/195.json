When a Pok\u00e9mon's counter reaches zero, that Pok\u00e9mon faints.  A Pok\u00e9mon that leaves the field will lose its counter; its replacement does not inherit the effect, and other Pok\u00e9mon's counters remain.\n\nThis effect is passed on by baton pass.\n\nThis move cannot be copied by mirror move.",
