    "effect": "Changes the terrain to Psychic Terrain for 5 turns.  Overrides electric terrain, grassy terrain, and misty terrain.\n\nAll Pok\u00e9mon on the ground are immune to moves with priority greater than 0.  (Moves that target the field rather than individual Pok\u00e9mon, such as spikes, are not affected.)  Additionally, when a Pok\u00e9mon on the ground uses a psychic-type move, that move's power is increased to 1.5\u00d7.\n\nIf a Pok\u00e9mon is holding a Terrain Extender when creating Psychic Terrain (by any means), the effect lasts for 8 turns instead of 5.",
