If the user is a lower level than the target, this move will fail.\n\nBecause this move inflicts a specific and finite amount of damage, endure still prevents the target from fainting.\n\nThe effects of lock on, mind reader, and no guard still apply, as long as the user is equal or higher level than the target.  However, they will not give this move a chance to break through detect or protect."
